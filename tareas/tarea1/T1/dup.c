Homework 1, "Programacion de Software de Sistemas" CC3301
Developer: Jorge Cummins
Assignment due: saturday, march 31, 2025

Preliminary information:
I was told that the homework should be checked by the faculty members from the 
section (assistants) just by running the assignment as specified in the instructions, 
therefore, they might not be reading the main code. Considering this and knowing that
there are no specific formal requirements for the code other than not using multiplication
and division, I will be developing the assignment in english, from the documentation to the naming
of variables. I took this desition because it might be a good instance for practicing my writing abilities 
in english.

Delopment information:
Run native: linux, debian 12. 
Run virtualbox: given image, windows 11 and debian 12.
